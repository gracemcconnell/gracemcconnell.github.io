<p>The last time you went for a drive, you probably passed around three or four fast food places. During long car rides? Probably around 20 in an hour. Fast food restaurants occur in every state in the United States and it is never a far trip to the nearest one. The popularity of fast food restaurants in America has become such a well known quirk that countries viewing on the outside often link Americans and fast food as things that go hand in hand. Sadly, with the overwhelming amount of quick-service dining presented in the United States of America, this is not far from the truth. The CDC reported that about a third of Americans eat fast food each day.</p>

<p>So what is the issue with this? Surely this statistic and opinion are not representative of all Americans, with some people living strictly on a diet based around clean eating. Fast food can be consumed as long as a person is remaining active and making sure they are eating it in moderation. The real issue stems from the deeply rooted systemic racism and classism that is so embedded in American society that it is a part of private corporate groups. The influence of these corrupted groups is one of the reasons behind the accessibility of unhealthier locations in impoverished areas, also known as food apartheids. The more well known phrase is food desert but Graduate Teaching Assistant April Lopez, who has a focus in food studies to view the food system via social justice, shared reasoning behind the recent stray from the word desert to aparththeid..</p>

<p>“ 'Food desert’ is an inadequate term because it assumes that it is a naturally occurring phenomenon, but that is untrue,” Lopez says. “Policies which have caused redlining, where freeways are installed, among other policies, all impact these areas' accessibility to grocery stores”. </p>

<p class="caption"> This graph demonstrates the popularity of "quick service" (fast food) restaurants compared to other categories. </p>

<p>The lack of access to fresh food and produce in underfunded communities, typically Black neighborhoods, demonstrates the system of oppression that is set up within the food system that stems from the segregation that occurred during the “white flight”. The “white flight” refers to a time in the 1950s and 60s when white Americans left communities and neighborhoods that were becoming more ethnically diverse and formed majority white suburbs. With this came a lot of economic hardships to the now predominantly Black communities who were denied houses in the suburbs by banks through the process of redlining. Specialized and chain grocery stores followed where the money ended up in order to make as much of a profit as possible. The money was in the white, upper-class suburbs and as a result a lack of access to healthier food was suddenly a large issue to those left in the low income and Black communities.  </p>

<p>Now, instead of each neighborhood having access to a grocery store, every corner of a neighborhood has a different fast-food restaurant. The fast-food industry has created a system in which certain stores have such popularity surrounding their name that the ability to chain and grow their numbers is easy. These restaurants created a culture in which prices are lowered with menu items “Super-Sized” and “Deluxe” versions of the originals. In an area where someone does not potentially have the time or money to waste making a trip to a grocery store miles away from them, it is easy to rely on the cheap food that can be picked up in the drive through on the way home from work. A reliance or excess consumption of fast food could come with devastating chronic health conditions.</p>

<p>There are many potential health effects from living in a food apartheids and sadly, because of the racial disparity surrounding them, a lot of the low-income colored communities are targets. As fast food items are often processed and high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and added sugar, there are both immediate and long term health risks. Public Health major and Peer Health Educator Brooke Kirchner outlines the potential for immediate health risks such as high cholesterol and blood pressure as well as the potential for chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. She warns that while the danger from fast food is well-known and documented, there is another health risk of becoming malnourished. In this case, a person wouldn’t be facing obesity, but being underweight due to a lack of proper nutrients in their diet. This can have just as many health impacts on a person.  </p>

<p>An important thing to note is that this is not an issue that can be fixed simply by building grocery stores in lower income areas. Grocery stores are still expensive and fast food restaurants will remain popular not because of their accessibility location wise, but because of the cheaper food being sold. This is an issue that needs to be solved by first addressing the background of the issue itself: the systematic oppression of the Black community through economic and medical inequalities.  It is not an issue that only exists within the food system, but this may be one of the simpler places to start. Possible solutions include community gardens, more accessible public transportation, evaluating the prices of items within grocery stores, etc. In order for this issue to be fixed, it needs to be addressed.  </p>
